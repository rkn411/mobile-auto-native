Automation Test Framework for Mobile Apps usin Appium-java (iOS and Android) 

# Framework Description:

The framework which I followed is 'TestNG Page Factory Model'. Below is the brief description on how this framework works:
Each page is defined as its own class.

Actions (including navigation) are represented as functions for a class.

Tests only talk to the page objects.

Page objects only talk to the driver.

Elements on the page are stored as variables for the page object

Class Inheritance can be used to define functionality to a set of pages.


# Prerequisites:
 
•	Java should be installed and path should be in environment variables.
 
•	Android sdk should be installed and path should be in environmental variables.

•	tools and platform tools path should be added to environmental variables path.

•	Appium server should be installed properly.

•	Maven should be installed path should be in environment variables.

•	TestNG should be installed in execution IDE (Eclipse is suggestible).

•	Import the framework to available IDE (Eclipse is suggestible).

# Update Login Credentials and Device UDID

Navigate to testdata.xlsx(testdata/testdata.xlsx), add the login(device udid, username and password values) credentials accordingly.

update device udid(deviceUDID value), we can get the device udid by a command "adb devices" after connect the real device/emulator to your system.



To run TestNG suite file:
 
Right click on testng.xml file and Run as TestNG Suite.

We can run individual test classes as TestNG classes.

Note: Testcase is available in MobileTest.java in test(src/test/java/com/amazon/test) package.
